# 📌 Dialogflow Chatbot (Experiment Project)

This is a **simple chatbot** built using **Google Dialogflow** and integrated into a basic HTML page using **Dialogflow Messenger**.
The project was created to **explore Dialogflow features** and test how easily it can be used for small data use cases like **support bots, FAQs, and basic assistants**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Dialogflow Messenger Integration** – floating chat bubble embedded in a web page
* ✅ **Intents & Responses** – easily customizable user intents and bot replies
* ✅ **Small FAQ/Support Bot** – answer common questions with structured responses
* ✅ **Custom Styling** – basic theme customization using CSS variables
* ✅ **Expandable** – can connect with Dialogflow Knowledge Connectors or external APIs later

## 🛠️ Setup & Run

1. Create a new agent in **Dialogflow Console** → [https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable **Dialogflow Messenger** from the **Integrations** tab.
3. Copy the generated `<df-messenger>` code snippet.
4. Replace your `agent-id` in the HTML file:

```html
<df-messenger
  intent="WELCOME"
  chat-title="Chatbot"
  agent-id="YOUR-AGENT-ID-HERE"
  language-code="en">
</df-messenger>
```

5. Open the `chatbot.html` file in a browser (preferably via a local server).

Example:

```bash
python -m http.server 5500
```

and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`

## 💡 Example Intents

Some basic intents to try inside Dialogflow:

* **Welcome Intent** → “Hi”, “Hello” → “Hello! How can I help you today?”
* **Fallback Intent** → “What is your working time?” → “We’re available 24/7!”
* **Emergency Intent** → “I have an issue” → “Please describe your issue in detail.”
* **Small Talk** → “Who are you?” → “I’m your friendly support assistant.”

## 🔮 Possible Extensions

* Add **Knowledge Connectors** to upload FAQs or docs.
* Connect with **Google Sheets or APIs** for dynamic responses.
* Integrate **Generative AI (Gemini / GPT)** for large-scale knowledge queries.

---

## 📖 Notes

* This is a **beginner-friendly experimental project** to learn Dialogflow basics.
* Works best for **small datasets** (FAQ bots, helpdesk support, simple chat assistants).
* For **larger datasets** or free-flowing Q\&A, combine Dialogflow with **LLMs and vector databases**.
